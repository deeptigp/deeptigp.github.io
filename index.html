description: I am a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Applied Research (FAIAR) where I work on problems pertaining to Computer Vision and Machine Learning, and their applications to the aspects of information retrieval such as search and storage.
Specifically, I focus on building biologically-inspired computational models to objectively measure perceptual image and video quality. I am also interested in other aspects of image processing and computational photography such as monocular depth estimation, visual saliency, and statistical feature learning.
