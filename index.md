I am a Senior Research Scientist at Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) in <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/"> Meta AI </a>where I work on Computer Vision, Image and Video Processing, and Machine Learning. I work on problems such as building fair and inclusive computer vision models, ML explainability, perceptual image and video quality, and large-scale video action recognition.

Prior to joining Facebook AI, I obtained my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 where I worked with Alan Bovik on perceptual image and video quality assessment for real-world content.
