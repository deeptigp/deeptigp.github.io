I am a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Applied Research (FAIAR) where I work on Computer Vision, Image and Video Processing, and Machine Learning. I work on problems such as perceptual image and video quality, large-scale video action recognition, fairness and inclusivity.

Prior to joining Facebook AI, I obtained my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 where I worked with Alan Bovik on perceptual image and video quality assessment for real-world content.
