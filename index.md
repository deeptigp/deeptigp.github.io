I am a Senior Research Scientist at Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) in <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/"> Meta AI</a> where I work a broad variety of topics in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Image and Video Processing. My interest spans several topics such as building image and video understanding models, fair and inclusive computer vision models, ML explainability, and perceptual image and video quality.

Prior to joining Meta AI, I obtained my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 where I worked with Alan Bovik on perceptual image and video quality assessment for real-world content.
